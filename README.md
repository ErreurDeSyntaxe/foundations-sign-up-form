# First Entry

This is the first project of the Full Stack JavaScript course of The Odin
Project. Finally! 16 lessons' worth of readings and exercises have come to 
an end. 

# Second Entry: Making A Plan

One aspect of the problem solving technique that I have been neglecting is
the planning. But for this project, I have made a draft of the web page and
thought of the challenges hidden within. Whenever my progress catches up to the
plan, said plan will have to be revisited and expanded upon. 

# Third Entry: Styling

The more I work on the Odin Project path, the more I dislike styling and the
front end in general. It is much like aesthetics in real life. I never cared
too much about my looks. Good enough is my aim. But for a job, a good enough
front end is terrible. It needs to be glorious, and I have a growing feeling
that I am not cut out for that part of the job. Design was never my strength,
and neither was style. Still, I trudge on.

# Fourth Entry: Starting Anew

I am unsatisfied with my project. Perhaps it is good enough, but it doesn't
feel good enough. I'll start from scratch.
